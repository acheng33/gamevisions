## SERVER
For now we are holding our project on a local server, but we will later try to set up a remote server so that it is easier to access our project. We are using django for our project, and it is quite simple to get a local server running. After all the necessary components of django are installed, we just need to cd to the project folder in a shell and run the command "py manage.py runserver" (in Windows) and it should lead us to the project page.
