## SERVER
Our project could be accessed by a remote server using AWS (ec2-3-128-246-252.us-east-2.compute.amazonaws.com). The domain name would change to a more descriptive name later. We are using django for our project, and it is quite simple to get a local server running. After all the necessary components of django are installed, we just need to cd to the project folder in a shell and run the command "py manage.py runserver" (in Windows) and it would lead us to the project page.
